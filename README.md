Some good software for those concerned about their OPSEC.  Geared towards journalists, but good for everyone!

##A Note of Caution
None of these tools are magic.  None of these tools, in and of themselves, will make you safer.  "Safer" is not a thing you can download; "safer" is a set of standards you hold yourself to, and every time you learn something new, your standards are set higher.  In our talk (7/20/14) we hoped to impart this message to you.  If you're just coming to this repo via twitter or word-of-mouth (good for you! ~waves hello~) please take the time to read some of the links/literature we've posted in this REAMDE first, especially those by the researchers at the Tow Center, Internews, CPJ, and Tactical Tech.  You will not regret it.
