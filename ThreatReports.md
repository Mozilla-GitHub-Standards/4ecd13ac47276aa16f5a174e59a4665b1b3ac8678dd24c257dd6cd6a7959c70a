Threat Reporting
================

This is a space for reporting current bugs effecting projects and software currently advocated here.  The format is only in markdown (for now); in the future, we might want to create a project that allows for easier input of bug-news, and a user-friendly system to help users comprehend. Maybe such a platform already exists...  But in the meanwhile, if you contribute here, please keep it neat and tidy.
